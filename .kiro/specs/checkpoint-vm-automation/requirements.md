# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature automates the initial configuration and ongoing management of Check Point VM appliances, starting from a fresh installation state. The solution handles the unique challenges of Check Point's initial setup process, including expert password creation and first-time wizard configuration, followed by object and firewall rule management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to automate the initial setup of a fresh Check Point VM, so that I can quickly deploy standardized firewall configurations without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to a fresh Check Point VM THEN the system SHALL authenticate using default credentials (admin/admin)
2. WHEN the VM is in initial state THEN the system SHALL set the expert password through the CLI interface
3. WHEN the expert password is set THEN the system SHALL complete the first-time wizard configuration via CLI, including updating the default password for admin user
4. IF the initial setup fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback options
5. WHEN the initial setup is complete THEN the system SHALL verify connectivity and basic functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to configure basic networking settings on the Check Point VM, so that I can establish proper network connectivity and routing protocols.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the initial setup is complete THEN the system SHALL configure IP addresses on additional interfaces beyond eth0
2. WHEN network interfaces are configured THEN the system SHALL configure OSPF routing protocol with specified areas and networks
3. WHEN OSPF is configured THEN the system SHALL enable and configure LLDP for network discovery
4. IF networking configuration fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and maintain connectivity on management interface
5. WHEN networking is configured THEN the system SHALL verify interface status and routing table entries

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to configure basic Check Point objects and firewall rules, so that I can establish a baseline security policy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN networking configuration is complete THEN the system SHALL create network objects as specified in configuration files
2. WHEN network objects are created THEN the system SHALL create firewall rules using those objects
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL commit the changes to the Check Point database
4. IF configuration fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and maintain system stability
5. WHEN all configurations are applied THEN the system SHALL verify the policy installation status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to choose between different automation approaches (Nornir vs Ansible), so that I can use the most appropriate tool for each phase of configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing initial setup THEN the system SHALL use direct SSH connections for low-level CLI interactions
2. WHEN performing ongoing configuration THEN the system SHALL support both Nornir and Ansible approaches
3. WHEN using Nornir THEN the system SHALL provide custom tasks for Check Point specific operations
4. WHEN using Ansible THEN the system SHALL leverage Check Point modules where available
5. IF one approach fails THEN the system SHALL allow fallback to alternative automation methods

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to handle Check Point's unique CLI behavior and authentication flow, so that automation works reliably across different VM states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to Check Point CLI THEN the system SHALL detect the current state (initial setup vs configured)
2. WHEN in clish mode THEN the system SHALL handle Check Point specific command syntax and responses
3. WHEN switching to expert mode THEN the system SHALL authenticate properly and maintain session state
4. IF CLI responses are unexpected THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
5. WHEN sessions timeout THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect and resume operations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to validate configurations and maintain idempotency, so that I can run automation scripts multiple times safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running automation scripts THEN the system SHALL check current configuration state before making changes
2. WHEN configurations already exist THEN the system SHALL skip redundant operations
3. WHEN validating configurations THEN the system SHALL verify objects and rules are correctly applied
4. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL report specific discrepancies and suggest corrections
5. WHEN automation completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of changes made and current state
